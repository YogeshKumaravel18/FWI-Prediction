🔥 Fire Weather Index Prediction – Regression Modeling (Milestone 2)

This milestone focuses on building regression models to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using the Algerian Forest Fire dataset.
The goal is to understand Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, regularization (alpha), sparsity, evaluation metrics, and how to save ML models using .pkl files.

📌 Project Objectives

- Train Linear Regression and understand its limitations
- Implement Ridge Regression with L2 regularization
- Use RidgeCV to automatically select the best alpha
- Analyze model coefficients, sparsity, multicollinearity
- Evaluate models using MSE, MAE, and R²
- Diagnose overfitting or underfitting
- Plot Alpha vs MSE cross-validation graph
- Save the final trained model using .pkl format
