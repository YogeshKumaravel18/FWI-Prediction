🔥 Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction – Flask + Ridge Regression

This project predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using a machine learning model trained on the Algerian Forest Fire Dataset.
A Ridge Regression model is trained and saved as ridge_fwi_model.pkl, and all input features are standardized using scaler.pkl.

A Flask-based web interface allows users to enter the forest weather values and get the predicted FWI instantly.

🚀 Features

✔ Ridge Regression model for FWI prediction
✔ StandardScaler for preprocessing
✔ Flask web app for user input
✔ Clean HTML UI (index + output page)
